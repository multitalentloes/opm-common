    The point of this file is defining macros like OPM_HOST_DEVICE to be empty if
    we do not compile for GPU architectures, otherwise we will
    set it to "__device__ __host__" to decorate functions that can
    be called from a hip/cuda kernel.

    The file also provides some definitions that will probably become useful later,
    such as OPM_IS_INSIDE_DEVICE_FUNCTION for specializing code that can be called
    from both GPUs and CPUs.
